# blog-json
A blog structure built on top of JavaScript and JSON

In case you're searching for a light weight structure where your only concern is to deploy your content to the viewers and eliminate all tedious hassle then this might be the way to go.

There are some more features in my head that can be added in this (like sorting by date, loading limited amount of posts, showing posts between two duration etc.), maybe I'll get to it when I have some spare time.

Everyone is welcome to improve, create new themes or find bugs.
